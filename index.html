        <h2>Marketers vs. Developers: The Dilemma</h2>
        <p>Making marketing websites for clients should ideally involve collaboration between the cool developers who
            actually make everything happen, and the marketing team, who should put together the strategy for what you
            want users to do, and how to make them do it.</p>
        <p>However, because marketing & development are often different departments, their work can be siloed and their
            goals can end up conflicting.</p>
        <p>This is bad for the client, because it means that their website is full of ugly compromises that don't
            contribute to them selling their product. But, much more importantly, it's bad because it pisses me,
            Shellie, off.</p>
        <p>This page will go over some basic best practices about how marketers & developers should talk to each other
            so that end products are cooler and I'm less angry.

        <h2>How Marketers Think About Websites</h2>
        <p>Marketers basically want a website to do two things: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Provide information relevant to users, depending on what kind of users the page will be getting</li>
            <li>Push those users through a sales funnel so that they buy the product or service.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Developers are mostly thinking about the same things! But sometimes they don't know a lot about the tactics
            that marketers use to accomplish their goals.</p>
        <p>For marketers, it's important that a website be able to publish the information that marketers' research
            shows will be most persuasive. Here's how to design a site in order to accommodate that information.</p>
        <h2>Checklist: Elements to Add to Your Website To Help Your Marketing Team</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>Make sure that marketers can add metadata to important page elements
            </h3>
            <article>
                <p>Developers often see metadata as extra, or not really part of the work that they're assigned to do. That's cool, someone else should be writing it for the developers.</p>
                <p>However, developers need to prepare a site so that all necessary metadata can be included by marketers. Without appropriate metadata, no one is going to be able to find the cool thing you made! So it's super important!</p>
                <p>Make sure that people adding content can add and change title tags, meta descriptions, and page indexing options.</p>
                <p>Also, content editors need to be able to set header tags and image alts. Search engines give a lot of weight to the content of your header tags when evaluating your site's relevance. Just changing the font of a page isn't good enough if you can't tell a search engine that the text is important!</p>
            </article>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan ahead for how new content will be added to the site
            </h3>
            <article>
                <p>Often, developers will think about the site in terms of the minimum viable product to be delivered. Probably only a few pages will need to be completely built out in order to deliver the site to the client. However, after the client gets the site, they're going to keep adding stuff to it! Is the site prepared to take on new content, especially if it's added by marketers, or, worse, the clients themselves?</p>
                <p>Make sure that the site is structured in such a way that it makes sense where to add new pages, depending on what you're accomplishing.</p>
                <p>If you've created the CMS for the site, evaluate how the content fields shape the content that will be added to the site. If you only have one image upload field per page, will you force your clients to only have one image per page? Will that work for your clients, or will they have other needs?</p>
                <p>And as we just discussed, make sure that everyone who will add content will be able to also add all the metadata that will help people find and use that content.</p>
            </article>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan ahead about content size
            </h3>
            <article>
            <p>Just like site structure, site design also needs to take into account the actual content that will live on the site. While most sites are responsive now, they're not always designed to accommodate text or image content that is different from the length anticipated in the design.</p>
            <p>For example, if your client is selling products that have extremely long names, you probably don't want to create a product category page that uses a tight grid and a large font size. If your client's product names were short, that would look awesome! But the design needs to reflect the context.</p>
            <p>Again, talk to the team that will be adding content to the site. Otherwise, when genuine instead of dummy content is uploaded, the client may ask for additional, belated design changes-- or make ad hoc changes of their own that break your design, or harm site optimization.</p>
            </article>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Code calls to action for all stages of the sales funnel
            </h3>
            <article>
                <p>Sometimes, developers can think about calls to action (or CTAs, if you're an asshole, which I am) as design elements first and tools second. When this happens, a site sometimes won't have all of the pieces that the client needs to get more customers.</p>
                <p>Work with your marketing team to think about all of the different ways that a user might want to tell the client that they want their stuff.</p>
                <p>For many pieces of content, you'll want to include several CTAs per page that are different based on the user's journey through a sales funnel.</p>
                <p>For example, a user who doesn't know your client well might want to download a brochure about their products. But a user who's ready to buy a product might want to make a purchase directly from a page.</p>
                <p>When the site has all of the tools necessary to capture all of these conversions, it'll make your client more money.</p>
            </article>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan for how user data will be gathered, stored and shared
            </h3>
            <article>
            <p>Like metadata, measuring site results isn't an optional site add-on-- it should be planned from the very beginning of site development.</p>
            <p>Work with your marketers to install the measurement tools that they will need to evaluate site performance.</p>
            <p>Make sure that all important site events can be recorded and tracked, and consider what sales database integrations could be useful from the outset of the project. Even if a client doesn't want to include complicated integrations from the inception of a project, setting yourself up for success by coding in a way that will integrate graciously will help you sell more work later on.</p>
            <p>When the site records user data, through form fills or another process, plan ahead with the marketing team to make sure that the right people receive that information, and that it is marked up in a way that makes it easy to use.</p> 
            <p>Marketers can then use insights from this user data to demonstrate to clients how wonderful the developers are.</p>   
            </article>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>But what's the catch, here?</h2>
        <p>What's really interesting to me about this project is that I'm quite certain that I've violated these instructions in several important ways--because I'm thinking like a developer first, rather than a marketer.
        </p>
        <p>One of the main reasons I wanted to take this class was to be able to better understand how these kinds of
            conflict come to be.</p>
        <p>For example: my main navigation is just kind of glued together out of hopes & dreams! It is not going to respond
            graciously to additions, or to elements of an unusual size! I couldn't even get the title in the same line! As soon as you have more than a few things
            you'll overrun the padding and everything will be ugly and frustrating. I'll have to build a whole new navigation design if I add more than a few pages. This is exactly why you don't want
            to design so that a design works without taking into account the information contained within the design,
            and how that information might change!</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Basically: do as I say, not as I do. And ignore that I didn't jack around with setting up a robots.txt or anything. I'm tired.</p>
