        <h2>Marketers vs. Developers: The Dilemma</h2>
        <p>Making marketing websites for clients should ideally involve collaboration between the cool developers who
            actually make everything happen, and the marketing team, who should put together the strategy for what you
            want users to do, and how to make them do it.</p>
        <p>However, because marketing & development are often different departments, their work can be siloed and their
            goals can end up conflicting.</p>
        <p>This is bad for the client, because it means that their website is full of ugly compromises that don't
            contribute to them selling their product. But, much more importantly, it's bad because it pisses me,
            Shellie, off.</p>
        <p>This page will go over some basic best practices about how marketers & developers should talk to each other
            so that end products are cooler and I'm less angry.

        <h2>How Marketers Think About Websites</h2>
        <p>Marketers basically want a website to do two things: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Provide information relevant to users, depending on what kind of users the page will be getting</li>
            <li>Push those users through a sales funnel so that they buy the product or service.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Developers are mostly thinking about the same things! But sometimes they don't know a lot about the tactics
            that marketers use to accomplish their goals.</p>
        <p>For marketers, it's important that a website be able to publish the information that marketers' research
            shows will be most persuasive. Here's how to design a site in order to accommodate that information.</p>
        <h2>Checklist: Elements to Add to Your Website To Help Your Marketing Team</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>Make sure that marketers can add metadata to important page elements
            </h3>
            <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan ahead for how new content will be added to the site
            </h3>
            <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan ahead about content size
            </h3>
            <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Code calls to action for all stages of the sales funnel
            </h3>
            <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <h3>
                <li>Plan for how user data will be gathered, stored and shared
            </h3>
            <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>But what's the catch, here?</h2>
        <p>What's really interesting to me about this project is that I'm quite certain that I've violated these
            instructions in several important ways--because I'm thinking like a developer first, rather than a marketer.
        </p>
        <p>One of the main reasons I wanted to take this class was to be able to better understand how these kinds of
            conflict come to be.</p>
        <p>For example: man my nav bar is just kind of glued together out of hopes & dreams! It is not going to respond
            graciously to additions, or to elements of an unusual size! As soon as you have more than a few things
            you'll overrun the padding and everything will be ugly and frustrating. This is exactly why you don't want
            to design so that a design works without taking into account the information contained within the design,
            and how that information might change!</p>
