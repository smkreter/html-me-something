    <h1>Marketing for Developers: How to Help Your Colleagues Make an SEO-Friendly and Conversion-Optimized Website</h1>
    <p>Making marketing websites for clients should ideally involve collaboration between the cool developers who actually make everything happen, and the marketing team, who should put together the strategy for what you want users to do, and how to make them do it.</p>
    <p>However, because marketing & development are often different departments, their work can be siloed and their goals can end up conflicting.</p>
    <p>This is bad for the client, because it means that their website is full of ugly compromises that don't contribute to them selling their product. But, much more importantly, it's bad because it pisses me, Shellie, off.</p>
    <p>This page will go over some basic best practices about how marketers & developers should talk to each other so that end products are cooler and I'm less angry.

    <h2>How Marketers Think About Websites</h2>
    <p>Marketers basically want a website to do two things: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Provide information relevant to users, depending on what kind of users the page will be getting</li>
            <li>Push those users through a sales funnel so that they buy the product or service.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Developers are mostly thinking about the same things! But sometimes they don't know a lot about the tactics that marketers use to accomplish their goals.</p>
    <p>For marketers, it's important that a website be able to publish the information that marketers' research shows will be most persuasive. Here's how to design a site in order to accommodate that information.</p>
    <h2>Checklist: Elements to Add to Your Website To Help Your Marketing Team</h2>
       <ol>
            <li><h3>Make sure that marketers can add metadata to important page elements</h3>
                <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Plan ahead for how new content will be added to the site</h3>
                <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Plan ahead about content size</h3>
                <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Code calls to action for all stages of the sales funnel</h3>
                <p>Info info</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Plan for how user data will be gathered, stored and shared</h3>
                <p>Info info</p>
