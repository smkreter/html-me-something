    <h1>Marketing for Developers: How to Help Your Colleagues Make an SEO-Friendly and Conversion-Optimized Website</h1>
    <p>Making marketing websites for clients should ideally involve collaboration between the cool developers who actually make everything happen, and the marketing team, who should put together the strategy for what you want users to do, and how to make them do it.</p>
    <p>However, because marketing & development are often different departments, their work can be siloed and their goals can end up conflicting.</p>
    <p>This is bad for the client, because it means that their website is full of ugly compromises that don't contribute to them selling their product. But, much more importantly, it's bad because it pisses me, Shellie, off.</p>
    <p>This page will go over some basic best practices about how marketers & developers should talk to each other so that end products are cooler and I'm less angry.

    <h2>How to Think About Stuff & Things</h2>
    <p>Here, I'm going to set your expectations about the entire class of thing that I'm selling. I'm going to try to convince you that the only important qualities that a thing of this kind <em>should</em> have are the qualities that the thing I'm selling, by coincidence, <em>does</em> have! Well would you look at that.
    <h3>The Thing Qualities: Product Tagline</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>It smells good:</h4> Obviously all marketing copy needs information about scent.</li>
      <li><h4>It solves the problem that you didn't know you had, but is the reason we made this product:</h4>
      Should we have done more market research before making these things? Yes. Did we do that research? Hell no. Now the marketing team has to convince you that you cared about this all along. That's cool, right?
      <li><h4>It's got a little nose:</h4> Who's got a good little nose? Oh it's you! Oh yes it is!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Much Do Stuff & Things Cost?</h2>
    <p>Let's be real, this is probably what you actually googled to get you here. Notice I've got this in an H2. I want your money-grubbing clicks.</p>
    <p>I'm not going to tell you unless this is an ecomm site, because I'm not a moron. You're gonna have to give me some of your personal information to get that info, sucker!</p>
    <p>Unless maybe I really do wanna prequalify people who are at this page, who knows what targeting limitations I was working with to get you here, maybe I'm not actually confident that you're a warmish lead.</p>
    <p>Listen, just fill out the form, okay.</p>
