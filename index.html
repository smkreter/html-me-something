    <h1>Marketing for Developers: How to Make a Website SEO-Friendly and Not Piss Off Your Colleagues.</h1>
    <p>I am sad now that I realize I assume all websites are for selling things. On the other hand: a whole lot of websites are for selling things.</p>
    <p>I know more about making websites for selling things than I do about other kinds of websites, so here I am, typing an HTML page and I'm automatically structuring it around selling some crap.</p>

    <h2>How to Think About Stuff & Things</h2>
    <p>Here, I'm going to set your expectations about the entire class of thing that I'm selling. I'm going to try to convince you that the only important qualities that a thing of this kind <em>should</em> have are the qualities that the thing I'm selling, by coincidence, <em>does</em> have! Well would you look at that.
    <h3>The Thing Qualities: Product Tagline</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>It smells good:</h4> Obviously all marketing copy needs information about scent.</li>
      <li><h4>It solves the problem that you didn't know you had, but is the reason we made this product:</h4>
      Should we have done more market research before making these things? Yes. Did we do that research? Hell no. Now the marketing team has to convince you that you cared about this all along. That's cool, right?
      <li><h4>It's got a little nose:</h4> Who's got a good little nose? Oh it's you! Oh yes it is!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Much Do Stuff & Things Cost?</h2>
    <p>Let's be real, this is probably what you actually googled to get you here. Notice I've got this in an H2. I want your money-grubbing clicks.</p>
    <p>I'm not going to tell you unless this is an ecomm site, because I'm not a moron. You're gonna have to give me some of your personal information to get that info, sucker!</p>
    <p>Unless maybe I really do wanna prequalify people who are at this page, who knows what targeting limitations I was working with to get you here, maybe I'm not actually confident that you're a warmish lead.</p>
    <p>Listen, just fill out the form, okay.</p>
